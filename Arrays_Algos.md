# Algorithms on ARRAYS

1. Write a Program to rotate the array elements.
2. Write a Program to rotate 'N' elements in an array.
3. Write a Program to Search an element in an array.
4. Write a Program to Swap block of elements in an array.
    Example:
    ```
    Given: Array and number of blocks to rotate
    A = [1,2,3,4,5]
    N = 2

    output:
            [2, 1, 4, 3, 5]
    ```
